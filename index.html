			<h3>Our vision</h3>
			<p>Whether it's old age, illness or simple depression, we've all feared death's cold embrace. </p>
			<p>Our vision is a comprehensive, cross-state plan that would allow ordinary families to afford 
				an elixir of life that will forever stave off that pesky reaper. </p>
			<p>Our materials are sourced naturally from hermits who have kept their secrets safe for centuries. 
				None can speak of them or know their countless names but they have one goal: satisfaction.</p>

		<div class="text-blocks" id="text-blocks-whyimmortality">
			<h3>Why Immortality?</h3>
			<p>Imagine a world where you no longer had to worry about sickness taking your life or that of a loved one. </p>
			<p>Imagine a world where your worst enemy is on their deathbed and you are continuing to live your life, 
				free from your burdons.</p>
			<p>Imagine this being available at a low, personal cost where we do all the legwork. 
				Take some time to think about it - time is one thing we have more than enough of.</p>

		<div class="text-blocks" id="text-blocks-caniafford">
				<h3>Can I Afford This?</h3>
				<p>Yes!</p>
				<p>None of us were meant to become billionaires. Instead of charging some exorbitant cost to keep our service 
					billed as luxury we chose a confidential, highly personal payment plant that covers what you are both able and 
					wanting to give. </p>
